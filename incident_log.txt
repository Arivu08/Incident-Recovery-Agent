Alert: High memory usage detected on service A
AI Decision:
Given the information provided, the first recovery step I would recommend is to investigate the recent deployment of version 3.4.2 on service A. It's possible that the new version has a memory leak or increased memory requirements, causing the high memory usage. Here are the steps you can take:

1. Review the release notes and deployment changes for version 3.4.2, focusing on any updates that may affect memory usage.
2. Check the application logs for service A around the time of the deployment to see if there are any error messages or warnings related to memory issues.
3. If you have access to a previous version of service A (e.g., v3.4.1), consider temporarily rolling back to that version to see if the high memory usage persists. This can help you determine whether the issue is related to the new version or not.
4. If the high memory usage is indeed caused by the recent deployment, work with your development team to identify and fix the underlying issue in version 3.4.2.
5. In the meantime, you may also want to consider adding more memory resources to the service A server to prevent any immediate downtime or performance issues.

Remember to continuously monitor service A's memory usage as you work on a resolution to ensure the issue is fully addressed.

Alert: High memory usage detected on service A
AI Decision:
Given the information provided, the first recovery step I would recommend is to investigate the recent deployment of version 3.4.2 on service A. It's possible that the new version has a memory leak or other issue causing the high memory usage.

Here are the specific steps you can take:

1. Review the deployment process and changes introduced in version 3.4.2.
2. Check the application logs around the time of deployment for any error messages or warnings related to memory usage or resource allocation.
3. If possible, rollback the deployment to the previous version and monitor the memory usage to see if it returns to normal levels.
4. If rolling back is not an option, consider restarting the service to clear any temporary memory usage or caching.
5. Monitor the service closely to ensure that the memory usage does not continue to increase, and be prepared to take further action if necessary.

In addition to these steps, it may be helpful to consult with the development team or system architects to gain a better understanding of the service's resource requirements and any potential issues with the recent deployment.

Alert: High memory usage detected on service A
AI Decision:
Based on the information provided, I would recommend the following recovery step:

1. First, monitor the situation closely to see if the memory usage drops on its own or stabilizes at around 95%. If it does, then no further action may be necessary.
2. If the high memory usage persists or continues to increase, you may need to perform a rolling restart of service A to clear any temporary or cached data that could be causing the spike. This can be done without affecting the availability of the service, since only one instance of the service will be restarted at a time.
3. If the high memory usage persists even after a rolling restart, or if the issue recurs frequently, you should consider deploying a newer version of the service or applying any available hotfixes to see if they address the memory usage issue. In this case, you may want to roll back to the previous version (v3.4.1) or deploy a different version (v3.4.3 or later) that has been tested and known to have better memory management.
4. If none of the above steps resolve the issue, you may need to engage the development team to investigate further and identify any potential bugs or issues that could be causing the high memory usage. This could involve code-level debugging, analysis of memory dumps, or other diagnostic techniques.

Alert: HighMemoryUsage
Summary: Memory usage > 90%
AI Decision:
As an incident recovery agent, the best recovery step for a high memory usage alert (Memory usage > 90%) would be to:

1. Identify memory-intensive processes: Use the 'top' or 'ps' command in Linux, or Task Manager in Windows, to identify processes consuming large amounts of memory.

2. Terminate unnecessary processes: If any memory-intensive processes are non-essential or can be safely stopped temporarily, consider terminating them to free up memory. Be cautious when stopping processes, as some may be critical to system functionality.

3. Add more memory (RAM): If high memory usage is a recurring issue and the system consistently requires more memory than is currently available, consider upgrading the system with additional RAM.

4. Allocate memory resources: In some cases, memory usage can be managed by adjusting the memory allocation settings for specific applications or services.

5. Monitor system performance: Keep an eye on the system's performance to ensure that the issue has been resolved and that memory usage remains at a manageable level.

6. Implement proactive measures: To prevent future occurrences, consider implementing proactive measures such as setting up alerts for memory usage thresholds, optimizing system configurations, and regularly reviewing system performance.

Alert: HighMemoryUsage
Summary: Memory usage > 90%
AI Decision:
As an incident recovery agent, the best recovery step in this situation would be to identify the processes that are consuming a large amount of memory and terminate or restart them as necessary to free up memory. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Log in to the server or system where the high memory usage alert was triggered.
2. Open the task manager or resource monitor to view the current memory usage by processes. On Windows, you can use the Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) or Resource Monitor (Windows key + R, type "resmon" and press Enter). On Linux, you can use the "top" or "htop" command.
3. Identify the processes that are consuming a large amount of memory. Look for processes with high memory usage percentage or high resident set size (RSS).
4. Determine if the processes are essential for system operation or if they can be safely terminated. If they are not essential, consider terminating them to free up memory.
5. If terminating the processes is not an option or if the memory usage remains high after terminating non-essential processes, consider adding more memory to the system or upgrading to a larger instance size.
6. Document the steps taken to recover from the high memory usage incident and communicate the resolution to relevant stakeholders.

Remember to always follow organizational procedures and guidelines when responding to incidents to ensure a consistent and effective response.
