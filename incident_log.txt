Alert: High memory usage detected on service A
AI Decision:
Given the information provided, the first recovery step I would recommend is to investigate the recent deployment of version 3.4.2 on service A. It's possible that the new version has a memory leak or increased memory requirements, causing the high memory usage. Here are the steps you can take:

1. Review the release notes and deployment changes for version 3.4.2, focusing on any updates that may affect memory usage.
2. Check the application logs for service A around the time of the deployment to see if there are any error messages or warnings related to memory issues.
3. If you have access to a previous version of service A (e.g., v3.4.1), consider temporarily rolling back to that version to see if the high memory usage persists. This can help you determine whether the issue is related to the new version or not.
4. If the high memory usage is indeed caused by the recent deployment, work with your development team to identify and fix the underlying issue in version 3.4.2.
5. In the meantime, you may also want to consider adding more memory resources to the service A server to prevent any immediate downtime or performance issues.

Remember to continuously monitor service A's memory usage as you work on a resolution to ensure the issue is fully addressed.

Alert: High memory usage detected on service A
AI Decision:
Given the information provided, the first recovery step I would recommend is to investigate the recent deployment of version 3.4.2 on service A. It's possible that the new version has a memory leak or other issue causing the high memory usage.

Here are the specific steps you can take:

1. Review the deployment process and changes introduced in version 3.4.2.
2. Check the application logs around the time of deployment for any error messages or warnings related to memory usage or resource allocation.
3. If possible, rollback the deployment to the previous version and monitor the memory usage to see if it returns to normal levels.
4. If rolling back is not an option, consider restarting the service to clear any temporary memory usage or caching.
5. Monitor the service closely to ensure that the memory usage does not continue to increase, and be prepared to take further action if necessary.

In addition to these steps, it may be helpful to consult with the development team or system architects to gain a better understanding of the service's resource requirements and any potential issues with the recent deployment.
